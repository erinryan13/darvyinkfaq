    <p id="design">
        <b>Design</b><br>
        Reference photos help me understand your vision, but please do not ask me to replicate or steal another artist's work. Ultimately,
        I will design something custom for you that no one else has. If you like my work, then you will like what I have designed! <br>
        I do not send drawings out ahead of time. This prevents theft and gives me the opportunity to explain the design in person. 
        This ensures we are all on the same page. Seeing the design day of also allows us to make any changes necessary. 
        We will never start until you are completely happy! <br>
        If you are unhappy with the design, please let me know, you and I both don't want to put something on you forever that you don't 
        like. This may result in a reschedule, I'll gather all the needed information while you are present to ensures we are both on the 
        same page.<br><br>
        <b>Flash</b><br>
        While I do custom work, I also have a book of already drawn, ready to go designs. Each piece has a fixed size and location it fits
         best on. These designs are already drawn up, usually with a color concept laid out. With these designs there are no changes to the
          concept as these are usually portfolio specific pieces. Each piece will be at a flat price, no matter how long it takes.

    </p>

    <p id="pricing">
        <b>Pricing</b><br>
        I normally charge by the piece so I can guarentee a price and you know how much 
        the tatto will cost going into it. In rare occasions, I'll charge by the hour if I can't forsee 
        how long the tattoo wil take me. <i>This will all be communicated prior to the tattoo.</i><br><br>
        
        Hourly rate is $160/hr.<br>
        Flash pieces are individually priced at a flate rate.<br>
        Minimum is $80.<br><br>
       
        <b>Deposits</b><br>
        A non-refundable $40 deposit is required for all appointments. A minimum of 24 hours
        notice is required to reschedule your appointment. I allow up to two reschedules before the 
        deposit is forfeited. I hold deposits for 6 months, after 6 months deposits are subject to 
        forfeiture. I will do everything I can to work with you, but I do not hold deposits indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p id="dayof">
        <b>Day of the Appointment</b><br>
        Please show up to your appointment time as scheduled. If you are running late, please call or text me at (570) 426-0770. <em>After 30 
        minutes late with no notice, I treat it as a no call no show.</em> <br>
        When prepping for your appointment, eat beforehand. You are also welcomed to bring a snack or drink to help you through the tattoo
        process. Do not apply any lotion the day of the tattoo. You are welcomed to use numbing cream but please reach out if it's your 
        first time or you are unsure how to use it. I will give you detailed instructions on how to apply and wrap it. <br>
        Please dress accordingly to your appointment. For example, if we are doing a tattoo on the leg, please wear shorts or loose pants. If you are
        unsure of what to wear for the area, we are tattooing let me know! I do my best to keep your modesty, but please keep how 
        you dress in mind when requesting tattoos, especially close to intimate areas. There are also privacy dividers available.<br><br>
        
        <b>No Call No Show</b><br>
        <i>No shows happen if there is no notice 30 minutes after your scheduled time.
        I generally reach out 24 hours before the appointment, to confirm with you and avoid any misunderstandings.</i> <br>
        If for any reason you cannot make your appointment, please reach out ASAP. This way I can free up that time slot to offer it to 
        someone else. One no call no show, will result in forfeiture of your original deposit and an additional 50% deposit for you to 
        reschedule your appointment. Two no call no shows, results in termination of you as a client. This is my livelihood, I will do 
        my best to respect your time, all I ask is for my time to be respected in return. <br><br>
        
        <b>Skin Prep</b> <br>
        I will not tattoo over bruises, rashes sunburns, wounds, or moles. <br>
        Please do not shave the area before hand, as we don't want to risk potential nicks or 
        razor burn on a healing tattoo. <br>
        Please do not apply lotion the day of the tattoo.
